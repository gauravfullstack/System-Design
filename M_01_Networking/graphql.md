# ⚔️ REST vs 🧠 GraphQL — The Smart Way to Talk to APIs

---

## 🧩 The Problem With REST APIs (The Motivation)

Imagine you're building a React app and you need to show:

> - User's name, email  
> - User's posts (titles only)  
> - Number of followers

### With REST APIs:
You might do:
- `GET /users/1` → to get user profile  
- `GET /users/1/posts` → to get posts  
- `GET /users/1/followers` → to get follower count  

That’s **3 API calls**, and each call returns **extra data** you don’t even need.  
You feel like:

> “Why am I over-fetching, under-fetching, and hitting multiple endpoints for one screen?!”

---

## 🧠 GraphQL Enters the Chat

> **GraphQL = Ask what you need. Get exactly that. In a single request.**

It’s a **query language for APIs** developed by Facebook, where:
- The **client controls the data shape**, not the server.
- **One endpoint**, many types of requests.
- **No over-fetching, no under-fetching**.

# 📚 What is GraphQL?

### ✅ Definition:
**GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs** that lets you request **only the data you need**, in the **exact structure you want**, with **a single endpoint**.

### 🔍 Key Points:
| Feature             | REST API                           | GraphQL                            |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Multiple endpoints  | Yes (`/users`, `/posts`, etc.)      | ❌ Only 1 endpoint (`/graphql`)     |
| Over/Under-fetching | ✅ Common                           | ❌ Never                            |
| Versioning          | ✅ REST v1, v2, etc.                 | ❌ No versioning needed             |
| Data Control        | Server decides                      | Client decides                      |
| Response Format     | Fixed (hardcoded JSON)              | Dynamic (client-defined JSON)       |

# 🏗️ Basic Building Blocks of GraphQL

---

## 1. 📝 **Schema**
- Describes **what data types** exist and what you can query.
```graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String
  email: String
}
```

---

## 2. 🔎 **Query (READ data)**
You ask exactly what you want, and you’ll get exactly that.
```graphql
query {
  user(id: 1) {
    name
    email
  }
}
```

📥 Response:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "name": "Gaurav",
      "email": "gaurav@example.com"
    }
  }
}
```

---

## 3. 🛠️ **Mutation (WRITE data)**
Used to **create, update, delete** data.
```graphql
mutation {
  createUser(name: "Gaurav", email: "gaurav@example.com") {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

---

## 4. 🛰️ **Single Endpoint**
- REST: `/api/users`, `/api/posts`, `/api/followers`
- **GraphQL: Only `/graphql`**
  - You pass query/mutation in request body (usually via `POST`)

---

## 5. 📦 **Resolvers**
- These are the **functions that fetch the data** behind each field.
- When you request `user.name`, a resolver fetches `name` from DB.

Think of resolvers like the backend logic that “resolves” your query.

---

## 6. 🔄 Nested Queries
GraphQL allows you to **fetch related data in one shot**.

```graphql
query {
  user(id: 1) {
    name
    posts {
      title
    }
  }
}
```

👆 In REST, this would require **2 or more requests**.

---

## 7. ⚠️ Error Handling
- GraphQL responses **always return 200 OK**
- Errors come in a separate `"errors"` array inside the response
```json
{
  "data": null,
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "User not found"
    }
  ]
}
```

# 💡 Why Learn GraphQL?

### 📈 In Interviews:
- Facebook, Shopify, GitHub, and many startups use GraphQL
- Shows you understand **modern API patterns**
- Helps in **System Design rounds**

### 💻 In Real Projects:
- Better suited for complex frontend apps (React, Next.js, mobile)
- Solves **real pain points**: less API maintenance, better performance
- Works amazing with tools like **Apollo Client**, **Relay**, **Hasura**

# 🧠 TL;DR Summary (1-Liners)

- **REST** = server controls shape + multiple endpoints  
- **GraphQL** = client controls shape + single endpoint  
- GraphQL uses **Queries**, **Mutations**, **Schemas**, and **Resolvers**  
- Solves over-fetching, under-fetching, versioning pain  
- Designed for **modern frontend apps**
