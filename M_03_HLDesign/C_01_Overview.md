# 🧭 **Frontend High-Level Design (HLD) – General Roadmap**

> This is the reusable **blueprint** you'll follow for every feature in frontend system design — clear, structured, and interview-friendly.

---

## 🔰 1. **Requirements Gathering**

### a. Functional Requirements

* What exactly should the user be able to do?
* CRUD operations? Filters? Media uploads? Comments?
* Define core user actions clearly.

### b. Non-Functional Requirements (Frontend-Specific)

* **Performance** (loading speed, API latency handling)
* **Accessibility** (screen readers, ARIA, focus)
* **Responsiveness** (mobile, tablet, desktop)
* **Security** (input sanitization, XSS/CSRF protection)
* **Authentication** (token flow, route guards)
* **SEO** (meta tags, SSR if needed)
* **Testing** (unit, integration, e2e)
* **Error Handling** (fallback UI, retry logic)
* **Internationalization (i18n)** (if global)

---

## 🏗️ 2. **Client-side Architecture Design**

### a. Folder Structure

* Feature-based folders
* Atomic Design / MVC split (optional)

### b. Views/Components

* Split UI into reusable, testable components

### c. Controllers / Hooks

* Handle business logic with `useXyz.ts` hooks or controller files

### d. Services Layer

* Handle API calls using Axios/Apollo/Fetch

### e. State Management (if needed)

* Context API, Redux, Zustand, Jotai

### f. Local Storage

* Cache drafts, tokens, or user preferences

---

## 📦 3. **Data Modeling**

* Shape of your objects/entities in the frontend
* Use `TypeScript` interfaces or Zod schemas

```ts
interface Post {
  id: string;
  caption: string;
  mediaUrl: string;
  createdAt: string;
}
```

---

## 🔗 4. **API Contracts**

For each API call:

* **Endpoint**
* **Method**
* **Request Payload**
* **Response Format**
* **Error Format**
* Pagination or Infinite Scroll structure

Document it like you would if the backend team asked you:
**“What exact data do you need?”**

## 🚀 5. **Optimization Strategy**

| Area           | Techniques                          |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Assets         | WebP, CDN, `srcset`, compression    |
| Data Fetching  | Lazy loading, SWR/React Query       |
| Rendering      | Virtualization (`react-window`)     |
| Code Splitting | Dynamic imports, route-based chunks |
| SEO            | SSR/SSG (Next.js) if needed         |
| Accessibility  | WCAG standards                      |

---

## 🧪 6. **Testing & Monitoring**

| Layer         | Tool                   |
| ------------- | ---------------------- |
| Unit Testing  | Jest + RTL             |
| API Mocks     | MSW                    |
| E2E           | Cypress / Playwright   |
| Error Logging | Sentry, LogRocket      |
| Performance   | Lighthouse, Web Vitals |

---

## 📘 7. **Documentation & Interview Summary**

Always be ready to summarize:

* Your **component and folder design**
* Your **API interactions**
* Why you **chose X over Y** (e.g., Zustand vs Redux)
* Your **performance decisions**
* How it handles **scale**, **edge cases**, and **accessibility**

## 💡 Tip for Interviews

Say this upfront:

> “I follow a modular HLD approach for frontend where I start with feature-level requirements, build scalable architecture, define API contracts, model frontend data, and then focus on optimizations and testing strategies. I can walk you through this with any feature you like.”
